# Instant Calling (MVP)


## Objective

*To radically transform and improve customer and agent experience by creating an 'instant call' solution, leading to improved customer experiences and stronger business performance in terms of cost to serve and conversion.*

**For Customers** - we want to give customers a new hybrid experience and feature as part of call 2.0 that  gives them the impression they are being called instantly on the journey when approrpiate by the agent. 

This will lead to:
* Better customer experience as less percieved waiting time
* Faster service for customers as more info gathered pre-call and a single agent 
* Better customer experience as they only have to speak to one dedicated agent and will not need to be put on hold/transfered
